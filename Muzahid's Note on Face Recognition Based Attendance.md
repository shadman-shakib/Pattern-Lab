## Introduction
Automatic face recognition (AFR) technologies have seen dramatic improvements in performance over the past years, and such systems are now widely used for security and commercial applications. An automated system for human face recognition in a real time background for a college to mark the attendance of their employees. So Smart Attendance using Real Time Face Recognition is a real world solution which comes with day to day activities of handling employees. The task is very difficult as the real time background subtraction in an image is still a challenge. To detect real time human face are used and a simple fast Principal Component Analysis has used to recognize the faces detected with a high accuracy rate. The matched face is used to mark attendance of the employee.Our system maintains the attendance records of employees automatically.Manual entering of attendance in logbooks becomes a difficult task and it also wastes the time. So we designed an efficient module that comprises of face recognition to manage the attendance records of employees.
Our module enrols the staff’s face. Being watched and/or monitored is a legitimate fear for many people. This is why facial recognition is slow to be accepted and welcomed in many industries. One industry or field of work that would benefit the most out of facial recognition though, is that of attendance systems. The applications of Face Recognition Based Attendance System could be found in Schools, offices, events, and many others.
