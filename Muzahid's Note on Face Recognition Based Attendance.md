**Face Recognition Based Attendance System** is than most of us can remember attendance at Schools/Collage/University as the tutor calling out our names/registered numbers and us yelling back “PRESENT, YES Sir!”. All of that could soon change with the introduction of facial recognition in these systems.

## Introduction
Automatic face recognition (AFR) technologies have seen dramatic improvements in performance over the past years, and such systems are now widely used for security and commercial applications. An automated system for human face recognition in a real time background for a college to mark the attendance of their employees and correnly using at school/Collage/University.

Being watched and/or monitored is a legitimate fear for many people. This is why facial recognition is slow to be accepted and welcomed in many industries. One industry or field of work that would benefit the most out of facial recognition though, is that of attendance systems. The applications of Face Recognition Based Attendance System could be found in Schools, offices, events, and many others.

## Advantages of Face Recognition
As you may already know, facial recognition systems need a database or a pre-recorded data set to compare captured images and identify faces.
A recent report out of China stated that a school has installed facial recognition technology in its classrooms to monitor students’ behavior.
In the same way, these cameras could be used to identify students and record their attendance in a class. With photos submitted to schools for various forms and documents, the students’ faces could be added to data sets to record their attendance in the respective classes.
Most offices and government buildings use biometric systems for logging in work hours and restricting access to only those people that are permitted. Although facial recognition is now being implemented in many countries for this purpose, they still largely rely on fingerprint sensors because of the lower chance of duplication and fraud. The downside to this is that recording a fingerprint is a task that requires relatively more effort.
