**Face Recognition Based Attendance System** is than most of us can remember attendance at Schools/Collage/University as the tutor calling out our names/ID numbers and us yelling back “PRESENT Sir, YES Sir!”. All of that could soon change with the introduction of facial recognition in these systems.

## Introduction
Automatic face recognition (AFR) technologies have seen dramatic improvements in performance over the past years, and such systems are now widely used for security and commercial applications. An automated system for human face recognition in a real time background for a Schools/Collage/University to mark the attendance of their students and also can observe the reaction over lecture.

Being watched or monitored is a legitimate fear for many people. This is why facial recognition is slow to be accepted and welcomed in many industries. One field of work that would benefit the most out of facial recognition though, is that of attendance systems. The applications of Face Recognition Based Attendance System could be found in Schools, offices, events, and many others.

## Advantages of Face Recognition
As you may already know, facial recognition systems need a database or a pre-recorded data set to compare captured images and identify faces.
A recent report out of China stated that a school has installed facial recognition technology in its classrooms to monitor students’ behavior.
In the same way, these cameras could be used to identify students and record their attendance in a class. With photos submitted to schools for various forms and documents, the students’ faces could be added to data sets to record their attendance in the respective classes.

## Advantages of Face Recognition Based Attendance System
Introducing facial recognition would cut down these inefficiencies since most modern facial recognition systems can perform the task in under two seconds. It is just a matter of collecting images of attendees at the time of issuing event passes.
This would also reduce the instances of ticket reselling as well as stolen or lost tickets being used by individuals that are not the official purchasers of said tickets.

## Disadvantages
### Image quality
The quality of the reference image plays an important role in the identification process. If the resolution of the said image is not high enough, it can cause cameras to be tricked into believing that the person being scanned is not the same as in the photo. An easy solution is to ensure that both the reference images and scanning are performed by similar cameras.

### Storage
Depending on the quality of the input data, a system would need an appropriate amount of storage. This could be troublesome if the data collected is of high quality and requires large amounts of storage space especially for events with a large expected attendance.

### Angles
Many non-premium facial recognition systems cannot account for faces that are captured at angles other than straight into the capturing camera. The disadvantage of this is that it makes the attendance marking process slower and less efficient.

## Recent Report on Face Recognition Based Attendance System
A school in China is monitoring students with facial recognition technology that scans the classroom every 30 seconds. A Chinese high school is using facial recognition technology to monitor and analyze students' behavior. The technology scans classrooms at Hangzhou No. 11 High School every 30 seconds and records students' facial expressions, categorizing them into happy, angry, fearful, confused, or upset which is close to our proposed system. The system also records student actions such as writing, reading, 1aising a hand and sleeping at a desk.
The "intelligent classroom behavior management system," according to Global Times, also records students' attendance immediately, and students' faces are used to pay for canteen lunches and below items from the library.
