Project Title: Face recognization for class performance with MTCNN face detection
Overview: Implementation of the MTCNN face detector for class presentation in Javascript. It is written from scratch, using as a reference the implementation of Face API (Face API: https://justadudewhohacks.github.io/face-api.js/docs/index.html)
MTCNN from David Sandberg
