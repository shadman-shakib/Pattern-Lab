Intro:
--------
Real time facial expression analysis of students to capture their attentiveness during classes.Also this can be use to help teacher if he or she needs to redesign their lecture or not so that students can easily understand the lectures more mannerly.
Machine learning gives computers the ability to make decisions from experience and improve itself without being explicitly coded while image processing is a procedure to extract information from an image by using machine learning algorithms and expression recognition is a way of categorizing images into different sections based on a.person’s facial expression and let computers sense human emotion
Using webcams, we will capture students’ expression and we will divide those facial expressions into two categories–attentive and inattentive. Both happy and neutral faces can be considered as the attentive face which we will determine using prior data(training data)

For this project we are learning MTCNN.
